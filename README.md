# Bad Joke Discord Bot
This bot scans for embeds / attachements sent to certain channels in a guild and replies to them with this image:

A user can add / remove channels from the log of channels set to be watched for embeds / attachments with `%addchannel` and `%removechannel`. Both of these commands require the manage channels permission to execute. `%help` can also be used to view these 2 commands. The bot can be invited to a Discord server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=723251861204762736&permissions=34816&scope=bot)
